# gvm

GVM provides an interface to manage Go versions.

Features
========
* Install/Uninstall Go versions with `gvm install [tag]` where tag is "60.3", "go1", "weekly.2011-11-08", or "tip"
* List added/removed files in GOROOT with `gvm diff`
* Manage GOPATHs with `gvm pkgset [create/use/delete] [name]`. Use `--local` as `name` to manage repository under local path (`/path/to/repo/.gvm_local`).
* List latest release tags with `gvm listall`. Use `--all` to list weekly as well.
* Cache a clean copy of the latest Go source for multiple version installs.

Background
==========
When we started developing in Go mismatched dependencies and API changes plauged our build process and made it extremely difficult to merge with other peoples changes.

After nuking my entire GOROOT several times and rebuilding I decided to come up with a tool to oversee the process. It eventually evolved into what gvm is today.

Installing
==========

To install:

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)

Installing Go
=============
    gvm install go1
    gvm use go1 [--default]
Once this is done Go will be in the path and ready to use. $GOROOT and $GOPATH are set automatically.

Additional options can be specified when installing Go:

    Usage: gvm install [version] [options]
        -s,  --source=SOURCE      Install Go from specified source.
        -n,  --name=NAME          Override the default name for this version.
        -pb, --with-protobuf      Install Go protocol buffers.
        -b,  --with-build-tools   Install package build tools.
        -h,  --help               Display this message.

List Go Versions
================
